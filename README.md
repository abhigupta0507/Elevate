# Fitness Web Application
# ELEVATE

Welcome to our **Fitness Web Application (Elevate)**! This project is designed to help users achieve their fitness goals through personalized workout and diet plans while staying motivated through community engagement. The platform is built using a React frontend and a Django REST framework backend with JWT token-based authentication.

## Features

### ü•ó Diet Plan
- **Explore Diet Plans**: Users can browse a variety of pre-defined diet plans tailored to different fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, maintenance).
- **Daily Meal View**: Once a user selects a diet plan, they can view the detailed meal schedule for each day, helping them keep track of their diet seamlessly.

### üèãÔ∏è Workout Plan
- **Custom Workouts**: Users can choose from several structured workout plans focusing on various fitness targets, such as strength training, cardio, or HIIT.
- **Track Progress**: Users can mark exercises as "done" to monitor their workout progress and maintain motivation over time.

### üåü Community Engagement
- **Community Posts**: Users can share their fitness journey, ask questions, and post motivational updates to inspire and be inspired by others in the community.
- **Like Posts**: Users can engage with community content by liking posts, building a supportive and interactive environment.
